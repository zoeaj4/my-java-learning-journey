My Java Learning Journey

This repository contains small Java programs created while learning Java fundamentals and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

It includes exercises about:

  Basic Java syntax
  Control structures
  Arrays
  Classes and objects
  Inheritance and encapsulation

More topics will be added gradually as I continue studying Java, including advanced OOP concepts, GUI programming, exceptions, collections, and multithreading.
This repository is part of my personal learning process and will grow over time.
