# My Notes on Inner Classes

As the name suggests, inner classes are classes that are defined inside another class.

## Why Are Inner Classes Needed?

Inner classes are useful for several reasons:

- They allow access to the private fields of another class without using accessor methods (getters or setters).

- They help hide a class from other classes in the same package, providing better encapsulation.

- They are useful when only one class should access the instance fields of another class.
